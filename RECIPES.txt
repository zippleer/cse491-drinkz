<177 arctic:~/cse491-drinkz/bin >python load-liquor-recipes test_rec.txt

The load-liqour-recipes function takes in a text file where each line represents a recipe.
The recipes should be added as:
RecipeName, Ingredient1, Amount1, ..., Ingredientx, Amountx

The text files may look better as a name followed by an ingredient list but I got frustrated by stripping apart the parenthasis and brackets. Got a problem with that?
