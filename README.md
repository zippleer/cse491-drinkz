THE STORY SO FAR:

You're throwing a mixed drinks party, where everyone is going to make
their own mixed drinks.  But your liquor cabinet is small and not that
well stocked, because you're a student, and you don't have any money.
What you really want is to list the stuff *you* have, and then have
people bring stuff that *they* have that complements your stuff for
the purpose of making the mixed drinks they want to make.  But there's
no app for that.

Hmmmm... a startup idea is born!

Running the tests:

To run the tests, 'nosetests'.  'nosetests -v' will give you the test names.
